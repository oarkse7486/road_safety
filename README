Omkar Sreekanth â€” Harvard data science project exploring machine learning methods.

This project applies machine learning and deep learning models to analyze U.S. traffic data, predicting accident risk and severity. Using techniques like random forests and TensorFlow, it identifies key factors such as vehicle age, safety features, speed limits, and road lighting that influence crash outcomes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Git

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sromee/road_safety.git
cd road-safety/
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Run the files in this order:

FARS_Initial_EDA_3-11-24.ipynb
FARS_Lin_Reg_Models_3-14-24.ipynb
FARS_Rand_For_Models_3-15-24.ipynb
FARS_SMOTE_Models_4-8-24.ipynb
FARS_Non_SMOTE_Models_4-8-24.ipynb
FARS_More_EDA_4-23-24.ipynb
CRSS_EDA_Plus_Models_4-29-24.ipynb

### Data
The FARS datafiles are included in the repo & were generated in the FARS_Initial_EDA_3-11-24.ipynb file.
The original data file used to create these FARS 6 data files is no longer available. The CRSS data file used 
for the CRSS_EDA_Plus_Models_4-29-24.ipynb is no longer available. But, the 6 data files provided here will make 
it possible to run every other file in this repo.
